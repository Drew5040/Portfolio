This project was completed during a three month virtual internship with Data Glacier, a data
analytics firm, from Aug. 2023 - Nov. 2023. Let me note that this project came from personal
interest in utilizing Bayesian Networks to extract value from data. It was completed during the 
internship, but on my own time. The main objective was to build and demonstrate the operation
of Bayesian Networks. I successfully researched this project from start to finish, meaning the only
prior knowledge I had of Bayesian Networks was the probability theory associated with them. The
data that was utilized is the same as the exploratory data analysis project in sample 1. I am 
particulary proud of this project as it allowed me to push my skills to the maximum while
simultaneously learning new ideas.  

Additions: A two part article published on my data science blog. It provides an in-depth 
           explanation of the probability theory essential to the networks, and how to build
           them step by step. Here is the link to the articles:
