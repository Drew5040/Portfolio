# Machine Learning: Building a Bayesian Network

This project was completed during a three-month virtual internship with Data Glacier, a data analytics firm, from Aug. 2023 - Nov. 2023. Note that this project was pursued out of personal interest in utilizing Bayesian Networks to extract value from data. It was completed during the internship but on my own time. The main objective was to build and demonstrate the operation of Bayesian Networks. I successfully researched this project from start to finish, with my only prior knowledge being the probability theory associated with them. The data utilized is the same as the exploratory data analysis project in sample 1. I am particularly proud of this project as it allowed me to push my skills to the maximum while simultaneously learning new ideas.

**Additions:**
A two-part article published on my data science blog. It provides an in-depth explanation of the probability theory essential to the networks and how to build them step by step. Here are the links to the articles:
