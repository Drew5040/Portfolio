                Hello!

                In this comprehensive project, I leveraged a multidisciplinary approach, combining the skills of
                web development, machine learning, and cloud computing to develop a simple yet dynamic web application
                that predicts income levels based on user-inputted demographic data. The core of the application is built
                upon a robust machine learning model, specifically a Decision Tree algorithm, trained and tested using a
                rich dataset of demographics.
                <br>
                <br>
                Development and testing of the machine learning model was conducted in Jupyter Notebook and PyCharm, and the Flask development
                server facilitated iterative experimentation and visualization, enabling the project's creation. Please keep in mind that
                the model is currently approximating 83% accuracy. Not much time was spent in the fine-tuning of the model, in favor of
                dedicating more time to perfect the styling of the web interface. The Python data science libraries utilized in
                bringing this project to life include Pandas, for the manipulation and cleansing of data; NumPy, for efficient array operations needed
                for model performance; and Scikit-Learn, for the Decision Tree algorithm itself. Moreover, many packages of Python's standard library
                were utilized such as Pickle, for the serialization of the model file for model portability; JSON, for data communication between the
                client side and the server side; and Logging, for the monitoring of the model's and site's performance.
                <br>
                <br>
                The web interface, developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Jinja2, offers a colorful user-friendly
                platform for users to input their personal demographic information, or the demographics of a fictitious person.
                The backend powered by Python & Flask, seamlessly integrates with the frontend, processing user inputs and interacting with the
                machine learning model for real-time predictions. JavaScript and Jinja2 templating enriches the frontend with dynamic content generation,
                enhancing user experience by providing immediate feedback based on the processed data.
                <br>
                <br>
                To ensure the projects maintainability and scalability, I employed the use of Docker for containerization,
                encapsulating the application and its environment to guarantee consistency across different development and
                deployment stages. For deployment, the application is hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, a managed service that provides
                automated scaling and load balancing, ensuring high availability and performance of the site and application. Domain
                management is handled through AWS's native Route 53 DNS service, establishing a professional web presence with my namesake as the custom domain.
                <br>
                <br>
                To alleviate any potential concerns over privacy while using the application, I have adopted a generic but
                comprehensive privacy policy, accessible via a link at the bottom of each page. This policy details the types of data collected
                from users and outlines how this data is—or is not—utilized. I personally guarantee that no demographic
                data is stored in databases for future use, nor is any data sold. Furthermore, All data that is inputted into the algorithm
                is erased immediately after the user exits the page, with the exception of certain logging details that consist of matrix data, but lack
                any identifying information, such as names or ID's. This approach ensures the utmost privacy for users during their interaction with the
                application. To further enhance data privacy and security, and to bolster user trust, I also secured an SSL certificate via AWS Certificate Manager.
                This critical step ensures all communication between the user's browser and the server is encrypted, safeguarding against "Man-In-The-Middle-Attacks"
                or eavesdropping, and data theft.
                <br>
                <br>
                For efficiency, scalability, and reliability, I opted for a reverse proxy setup with an application server, employing
                Gunicorn for the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) or HTTP server that directly interacts with the web application's Python code.
                Additionally, I utilized the high performance Nginx server within the isolated environment of the Docker container to handle client requests.
                This configuration ensures that the application can efficiently manage traffic, scale as I add more content to the site, and provide reliable access
                to users, while maintaining a clear separation of concerns between the application processing and request handling.
                <br>
                <br>
                I will soon be adding a contact form and improving the site's aesthetics as soon as the code is ready for deployment. For now, you may
